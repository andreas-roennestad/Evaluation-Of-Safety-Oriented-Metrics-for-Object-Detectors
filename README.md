# Evaluation of Safety-Oriented Metrics for Object Detectors
The Python and Jupyter Notebook files provided in this repository implements all methods and functionality applied in 
my Master's Thesis "Evaluation of Safety-Oriented Metrics for Object Detectors".
The thesis was written for the Department of Computer Science (IDI) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

Part of this repository builds on the [nuScenes-devkit](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), 
which also uses the Apache 2.0 license. Specifically, the directories `metrics_models/eval/` and `metrics_models/utils/` extends the 
corresponding directories of the nuScenes devkit. Furthermore, it extends the modified nuScenes devkit provded in 
[Object criticality model](https://github.com/AndreaCeccarelli/metrics_model), by Andrea Ceccarelli and Leonardo Montecchi.

##  Scope of the repository
The experimental work performed as part of the thesis involved the comparison of two approaches for the 
safety-oriented evaluation of object detectors, namely [PKL](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/planning-centric-metrics) and 
the [Object Criticality Model](https://github.com/AndreaCeccarelli/metrics_model).
